This program was made to submit plausibly realistic but false reports to defendkidstx.com.

This program should be usable for any rearrangement of the layout of the defendkidstx website
as long as the reporting process itself remains the same.

This program controls your cursor and keyboard, so it is not advisable to attempt to use
those functions while the program is running. Between cursor movements there is at least
a 3 second pause giving the user an opportunity to close the window in case of a problem.
You can also end the program by clicking the program window and pressing "ctrl+c". You may
wish to use a VPN while interacting with defendkidstx.com. Multiple reports from your IP
address may lead to your being blocked from accessing the website.
